## Abstract
The fusion of input and guidance images that have a tradeoff in their information (e.g., hyperspectral and RGB image fusion or pansharpening) can be interpreted as one general problem. However, previous studies applied a task-specific handcrafted prior and did not address the problems with a unified approach. To address this limitation, in this study, we propose a guided deep decoder network as a general prior. The proposed network is composed of an encoder-decoder network that exploits multi-scale features of a guidance image and a deep decoder network that generates an output image. The two networks are connected by feature refinement units to embed the multi-scale features of the guidance image into the deep decoder network. The proposed network allows the network parameters to be optimized in an unsupervised way without training data. Our results show that the proposed network can achieve state-of-the-art performance in various image fusion problems.

## Usage
Create and use a python venv (local):

* `python3 -m venv venv`
* `source venv/bin/activate`
* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

One time formatting:
* `venv/bin/isort GDD_code`
* `venv/bin/black GDD_code`

`cd` to GDD_code and run the scripts - requires `cudnn.enabled` (i.e. GPU, e.g. Colab)

## Issues
- `python3 GDD_demo_HS.py` results in error `OSError: could not read bytes`
- `python3 GDD_demo_PAN.py` -> it is necessary to create `result/PAN/` folder (added in this fork)
